# MrAnfieldFootball.tech - Editorial Standards & Authority Framework

## Mission Statement

**We exist to make football discourse smarter, clearer, and more honest.**

If an article doesn't teach something, challenge something, or clarify something, we don't publish it.

---

## Core Editorial Principles

### 1. Evidence Over Speculation

**✅ We DO:**

- Base analysis on watching matches
- Use stats to support arguments (not replace them)
- Screenshot tactical moments
- Quote managers/players when relevant
- Cite credible sources (clubs, verified journalists)

**❌ We DON'T:**

- Print transfer rumors without credible sources
- Speculate on injuries, contracts, or personal issues
- Use "sources say" without verification
- Treat Twitter ITKs as legitimate
- Publish hearsay as fact

---

### 2. Context Always Matters

**✅ We DO:**

- Consider opponent quality
- Note match circumstances (injuries, suspensions, weather)
- Remember season-long trends (don't judge on one match)
- Acknowledge when data is limited

**❌ We DON'T:**

- Overreact to single matches
- Ignore context for a hot take
- Compare players without accounting for system/team quality
- Declare someone "finished" after a bad game

---

### 3. Clarity Over Jargon

**✅ We DO:**

- Explain tactical terms the first time we use them
- Use simple language when possible
- Break complex concepts into understandable parts
- Assume readers are smart, not that they know everything

**❌ We DON'T:**

- Use jargon to sound smart
- Overcomplicate simple ideas
- Write for other analysts instead of readers
- Gatekeep football knowledge

---

### 4. Opinions Must Be Defensible

**✅ We DO:**

- Have strong opinions backed by evidence
- Criticize tactics, not character
- Praise excellence when we see it
- Acknowledge valid counterarguments

**❌ We DON'T:**

- Make lazy hot takes for engagement
- Attack players/managers personally
- Flip opinions based on one result
- Hide behind "just my opinion" when we're factually wrong

---

### 5. Write Like a Human

**✅ We DO:**

- Show passion for the game
- Use natural, conversational language
- Vary sentence structure
- Let personality come through

**❌ We DON'T:**

- Sound like AI ("delve," "moreover," "it is worth noting")
- Use corporate speak
- Write in passive voice constantly
- Bore readers with robotic analysis

---

## Fact-Checking Process

### Before Publishing, Verify

**Match Details:**

- Final score
- Goal scorers and times
- Formations (check multiple sources)
- Key substitutions

**Player/Manager Quotes:**

- Watch press conference or read official transcripts
- If quoting media, cite the original source
- Never use fake quotes for humor/satire without labeling

**Statistics:**

- Use credible sources (WhoScored, FBref, official league data)
- Don't cherry-pick stats to fit narrative
- Provide context (e.g., "X completed 90% of passes... in his own half")

**Transfer News:**

- Tier 1 sources only (official clubs, BBC, The Athletic, Fabrizio Romano *when he says "Here We Go"*)
- Label rumors as rumors
- Update articles if information changes

---

## Corrections Policy

### When We Make Mistakes

**Minor Errors (spelling, wrong minute for a goal, etc.):**

- Correct silently
- Note at bottom if it changes meaning: *"Correction: Updated goal time from 34' to 32'."*

**Major Errors (wrong formation, misidentified player, factual error):**

- Correct immediately
- Add prominent note at top:
  > **Correction (Dec 29, 2024):** An earlier version of this article stated Arsenal played a 4-2-3-1. They actually played a 4-3-3. We regret the error.

**Wrong Analysis/Prediction:**

- Acknowledge it in a new piece
- Link back to original with note: *"We originally predicted X. We were wrong. Here's why."*

**Never:** Delete articles or silently change positions.

---

## Transparency Guidelines

### What We Disclose

**Sponsored Content:**

- Clearly labeled at the top of every sponsored article
- "This article is sponsored by [Brand]. All analysis and opinions are our own."

**Affiliate Links:**

- Footer notice on any page with affiliate links
- "This article contains affiliate links. We may earn a commission."

**Conflicts of Interest:**

- If writing about a team/player we have personal ties to, disclose it
- Example: "Disclosure: I've supported Liverpool for 20 years. This analysis aims to be objective, but bias is always possible."

**Sources:**

- When quoting stats, articles, or interviews, cite the source
- Link to original reporting when discussing news

---

## Author Standards

### Every Author Must

1. **Watch the matches they write about**  
   No writing based on highlights or stats alone.

2. **Fact-check their work**  
   Verify scores, formations, quotes before publishing.

3. **Write clearly and honestly**  
   No hiding behind jargon or vague language.

4. **Respect deadlines**  
   Fast is good, but accuracy is better. If you need more time, say so.

5. **Engage with feedback**  
   If readers or editors point out errors, acknowledge and correct.

6. **Avoid plagiarism (obviously)**  
   Original analysis only. If referencing someone else's work, cite it.

## Editorial Hierarchy

### Who Decides What Gets Published?

**For Now (Solo Operation):**

- You write, you edit, you publish
- Self-editing checklist (see below)

**When We Scale:**

- **Managing Editor:** Final say on all content
- **Contributing Writers:** Pitch ideas, submit drafts
- **Editorial Team:** Reviews for accuracy, clarity, quality

---

## Self-Editing Checklist

Before publishing any article, ask:

- [ ] **Is this original?** (Not just repeating what everyone else said)
- [ ] **Is this accurate?** (Facts checked, sources cited)
- [ ] **Is this clear?** (Could a casual fan understand it?)
- [ ] **Is this valuable?** (Does the reader learn something?)
- [ ] **Is this fair?** (Criticism is evidence-based, not personal)
- [ ] **Is this readable?** (Varied sentence structure, natural flow)
- [ ] **Is this free of AI-sounding language?** (No "delve," "moreover," etc.)
- [ ] **Have I proofread for typos?**

If any answer is "no," revise before publishing.

## What We Don't Publish (Banned Content Types)

### ❌ Banned

1. **Unverified Transfer Rumors**  
   Unless from Tier 1 sources, we don't publish it.

2. **Player Ratings**  
   Subjective, boring, adds no value. We prefer analysis over arbitrary numbers.

3. **Clickbait Listicles**  
   "5 Things We Learned" is lazy. We do deep analysis, not shallow lists.

4. **Fake Quotes or Satire Without Labeling**  
   Satire is fine if clearly labeled. Fake quotes presented as real are not.

5. **Personal Attacks**  
   Criticize tactics, performances, decisions. Never attack character, appearance, or personal life.

6. **Engagement Bait**  
   "You won't BELIEVE..." or "This will SHOCK you..."—if we need tricks, we've failed.

7. **AI-Generated Content Without Heavy Editing**  
   AI can assist (research, outlines), but final content must sound human.

## Credibility-Building Tactics

### How We Earn Trust

**1. Consistency**  
Publish regularly. Show up. Build a track record.

**2. Accountability**  
When we're wrong, we admit it. When we're right, we don't gloat.

**3. Depth**  
One great 3000-word analysis beats ten shallow 500-word takes.

**4. Independence**  
We don't parrot club PR. We analyze objectively, even when it's uncomfortable.

**5. Engagement**  
We respond to thoughtful criticism. We ignore trolls.
