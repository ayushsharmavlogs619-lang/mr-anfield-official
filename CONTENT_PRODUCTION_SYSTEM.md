## Quality Control Standards

### ✅ Publish If

- Original insight (not just repeating what everyone else said)
- Clear structure and logical flow
- Backed by evidence (stats, examples, screenshots)

- Adds value to football discourse

### ❌ Don't Publish If

- No evidence, just vibes
- Sounds like AI wrote it
- Adds nothing new to the conversation

## Content Graveyard (What We Don't Publish)

- Transfer rumors without credible sources
- "5 Things We Learned" listicles (lazy)
- Player ratings (subjective, boring)
- Match previews that are just lineups and stats
- Reactionary hot takes without analysis
- Anything that sounds like ChatGPT
