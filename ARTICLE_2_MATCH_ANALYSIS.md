Liverpool edged past Chelsea 2-1 at Anfield in a tactical chess match that showcased Arne Slot's growing command of this squad.

**The Story:** Chelsea dominated possession early (58% in first 20 minutes) but couldn't break down Liverpool's compact mid-block. One tactical adjustment from Slot in the 34th minute changed everything.

Here's exactly how Liverpool dismantled Chelsea's gameplan.

---

## The Formations

### Liverpool Tactical Setup

4-3-3 (transitioning to 4-2-3-1 in possession)

- Alisson
- Alexander-Arnold - Konaté - Van Dijk - Robertson
- Mac Allister - Gravenberch - Szoboszlai
- Salah - Núñez - Díaz

### Chelsea Tactical Setup

4-2-3-1 (pressing with 4-4-2 shape)

- Sánchez
- James - Disasi - Silva - Chilwell
- Caicedo - Fernández
- Palmer - Gallagher - Sterling
- Jackson

---

## Phase 1: Chelsea's Early Dominance (0-20 min)

Chelsea started aggressively, pressing Liverpool's build-up with Jackson and Gallagher cutting off passing lanes to Mac Allister.

### Chelsea's Press Structure

- Jackson blocks Alisson → Van Dijk
- Gallagher shadows Mac Allister
- Palmer and Sterling pinch narrow to trap fullbacks
- Caicedo and Fernández ready to pounce on turnovers

### Liverpool's Response to Press

Slot instructed Alexander-Arnold to drop between center-backs, creating a back three. This pulled Chelsea's press wider and created space for Gravenberch to receive between lines.

### Key Stats (0-20 min)

- Chelsea possession: 58%
- Liverpool successful passes: 112/134 (83%)
- Turnovers in Liverpool's third: 7

---

## The Turning Point: Slot's 34th Minute Adjustment

At 0-0 in the 34th minute, Slot made a subtle but devastating change:

1. **Mac Allister dropped deeper** (almost as a third center-back)
2. **Szoboszlai pushed higher** (into the #10 space)
3. **Gravenberch rotated left** (occupying the left half-space)

This created a **numerical advantage in midfield** (4 vs Chelsea's 2) and overloaded Chelsea's right side.

### Why the Midfield Adjustment Worked

1. Caicedo and Fernández couldn't press 4 Liverpool midfielders
2. Reece James was isolated 2v1 (Díaz + Robertson)
3. Szoboszlai's higher position pulled Caicedo out, creating space for Gravenberch to drive forward

### Result: Liverpool's first goal (42nd min)

- Gravenberch receives in space
- Drives at Chelsea's backline
- Lays off to Szoboszlai
- Szoboszlai threads through ball to Salah
- **Salah finishes low past Sánchez (1-0)**

## Salah's Movement Masterclass

Mohamed Salah didn't just score—he systematically destroyed Chelsea's defensive structure.

### Detailed Salah Movement Breakdown

- Started right wing (standard)
- Drifted centrally when Mac Allister dropped
- Pulled Disasi narrow, creating space for Alexander-Arnold overlaps
- Made 14 runs in behind (Chelsea caught offside trap 6 times)

### Key Salah Moments

#### 42' - The Goal

- Recognized Gravenberch had space
- Delayed run to stay onside
- Perfect first touch to create shooting angle
- Finish: Low, far post (xG: 0.31 - clinical)

#### 67' - The Assist (Liverpool 2-0)

- Dropped deep to receive
- Drew two defenders
- Flicked to Núñez who finished
- (Núñez's goal later ruled offside, but the concept worked)

### Salah Match Statistics

- Touches: 64
- Successful dribbles: 4/7
- Key passes: 3
- Shots: 5 (3 on target)
- Defensive actions: 2 interceptions, 1 tackle

## Chelsea's Equalizer & Liverpool's Response

### Chelsea's Equalizer (59')

Cole Palmer's moment of individual brilliance. Received between lines, turned Van Dijk, curled past Alisson. **(1-1)**

**Nothing Liverpool could do** - world-class finish (xG: 0.09).

### Slot's Immediate Adjustment (61')

- Brought on Jones for Szoboszlai (fresh legs in midfield)
- Instructed Robertson to push higher
- Díaz moved to #10 role
- Created 3v2 overload on Chelsea's right again

### Liverpool's Winner (78')

Díaz pressed Disasi → turnover → Mac Allister through ball → Núñez **2-1**

---

## Tactical Breakdown: Why Liverpool Won

### 1. Midfield Rotation

Liverpool's fluid midfield (Mac Allister dropping, Szoboszlai pushing, Gravenberch rotating) created constant numerical advantages. Chelsea's rigid 4-2-3-1 couldn't adapt.

### 2. Exploiting Chelsea's Right Side

Reece James was isolated repeatedly. Robertson + Díaz created 9 dangerous situations down that channel.

### 3. Pressing Trigger

### Match Turnover Statistics

- **Turnovers forced in Chelsea's half:** 11 total turnovers.

### 4. Defensive Solidity

Van Dijk and Konaté were immense. Blocked 8 shots combined. Won 14/16 aerial duels.

## Manager Quotes

### Arne Slot
>
> "We knew Chelsea would press high. The adjustment was to create more options in midfield. Mac Allister dropping allowed Dominik [Szoboszlai] to find space. That's where we hurt them."

### Mauricio Pochettino
>
> "We dominated the first 30 minutes but didn't capitalize. Their rotation in midfield caused us problems. We need to be more adaptable."
