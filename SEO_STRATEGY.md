- Use keywords in unnatural ways ("the inverted fullback is when inverted fullback does inverted fullback things")
- Sacrifice readability for SEO
- Use exact-match keywords in every paragraph

---

## Backlink Strategy

Football media lives on backlinks. Here's how to earn them:

### 1. **Data-Driven Content**

Create original stats, visualizations, or research that other outlets will cite.

Example: "We analyzed 500 Premier League matches and found that teams using inverted fullbacks win 62% of the time."

### 2. **Controversy & Hot Takes**

Write bold, defensible opinions that other sites will reference or argue against.

Example: "Why Pep Guardiola Is Overrated" (if backed by tactical evidence).

### 3. **Breaking Tactical Trends First**

Be the first to identify and explain new tactical trends. Other outlets will link to you as the source.

### 4. **Journalist Outreach**

Email football journalists when you publish strong analysis. Many will link to it in their own pieces.

### 5. **Guest Posts**

Write for other football sites and link back to your deep-dive articles.

## Avoiding SEO Pitfalls

### ❌ Thin Content

Don't publish 300-word articles. Google rewards depth. Aim for 1000+ words minimum.

### ❌ Duplicate Content

Don't copy from other sites. Write original analysis.

### ❌ Clickbait Headlines

"You Won't BELIEVE What Pep Did!" is garbage. Write compelling headlines that deliver on the promise.

### ❌ Ignoring Search Intent

If someone searches "false 9 explained," give them a clear explanation—not a 3000-word history of every false 9 ever.

### ❌ Over-Optimization

If your article reads like it was written for robots, you've failed. Write for humans first.
