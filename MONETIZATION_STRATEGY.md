# MrAnfieldFootball.tech - Monetization Strategy

## Core Principle

**Monetize attention without destroying trust.**

Football fans can smell a sellout from a mile away. If we prioritize money over quality, we lose credibility. And without credibility, we have nothing.

So: monetize intelligently, transparently, and ethically.

## Revenue Projection (Conservative)

### Scenario: 50K Monthly Visitors

| Revenue Stream                   | Monthly Revenue      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Display Ads (Google AdSense)     | $500-1,500           |
| Affiliate Marketing              | $200-500             |
| Premium Memberships (100 members)| $500                 |
| Sponsored Content (1 per month)  | $500-1,000           |
| **TOTAL**                        | **$1,700-3,500/mo**  |

---

### Scenario: 200K Monthly Visitors

| Revenue Stream                   | Monthly Revenue      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Display Ads (Mediavine)          | $4,000-8,000         |
| Affiliate Marketing              | $800-1,500           |

**Bottom Line:**

Monetization is a long game. We prioritize audience growth and trust first. Revenue follows.

If we build a loyal audience of 100K+ monthly readers, revenue becomes inevitable.

But if we chase revenue too early and lose trust, we'll never recover.

Quality first. Always.
